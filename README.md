This repository contains a Python function that demonstrates an uncommon error related to zero division and unexpected return values.  The function `function_with_uncommon_error` aims to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero. However, it contains a subtle error that leads to unexpected behavior when both `a` and `b` are zero. The `bug.py` file shows the buggy code, and `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version.
